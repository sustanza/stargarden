# StarGarden Theme

StarGarden is a simple [Astro](https://astro.build/) theme built from the original CBHReviews site. It showcases how to list content, render Markdown pages, and use Tailwind with DaisyUI.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The theme includes example pages and a basic layout. Customize the content under `src/` to make it your own.
