title: "Warranty Claim - Carpet Inspection"
---

Despite my attempts to reach out the day before, the CBH carpet inspector still arrived as scheduled. He identified multiple defects and acknowledged issues with the initial carpet installation. To properly address the poor workmanship, he explained that nearly all of the upstairs carpet would need to be replaced, as the linear design makes it impossible to match replacement sections with the existing pattern.
