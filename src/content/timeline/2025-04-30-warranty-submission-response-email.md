title: "Warranty Submission Reponse Email"

Received an email from the warranty coordinator stating they couldn’t open the files I sent and asking for JPEGs or PDFs instead—despite the fact that I had already attached PDFs and only included a YouTube link for video evidence. This contradicted our earlier phone call, where they confirmed YouTube links were acceptable and said it was easier to keep everything in the original email thread because the warranty portal is limited.
