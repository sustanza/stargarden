title: "Whole Home Air Filter"
---

After moving in, I inspected the HVAC fresh‑air system and discovered the intake only had a minimal filter. Because Boise’s wildfire season can bring heavy smoke, I asked CBH’s HVAC subsidiary to install a whole‑home filter to clean the incoming outdoor air. The crew did quality work at a fair price and the new filter has performed well. I still plan to add a higher‑grade pre‑filter directly after the fresh‑air intake—unfiltered air can still get in under the current design.
