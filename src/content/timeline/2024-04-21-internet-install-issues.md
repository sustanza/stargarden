Before move‑in, I discovered that the fiber line terminated in the garage and then looped the single in‑wall Ethernet drop back outside, leaving indoor‑rated cable exposed to the weather. CBH said this was the ISP’s problem, but the ISP tech showed that CBH’s mis‑routed drop left them no choice. The tech rerouted the cable properly—keeping all wiring indoors—at no extra cost. Issue resolved, although most homes in the neighborhood appear to share the same CBH wiring oversight.
