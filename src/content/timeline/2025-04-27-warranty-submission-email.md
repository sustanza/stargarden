Sent an email to the warranty coordinator with a video (filmed April 27, 2025) highlighting ongoing flooring and window/door issues, and asked for confirmation that the link was accessible. Reiterated that all warranty claims will continue through this email thread and the builder’s portal. I let them know I'm launching CBHReviews.com to publicly document our experience—clarifying it won’t change how I submit claims. Also reminded them that several “completed” window and door items remain unresolved and promised more photos/videos before the one‑year deadline.
