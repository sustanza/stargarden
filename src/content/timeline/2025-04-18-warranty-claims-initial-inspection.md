title: "Warranty Claim - Initial Inspection"

CBH conducted their first onâ€‘site inspection and agreed that several upstairs and downstairs floor areas showed unacceptable defects. They suggested the subfloor may not have been sanded properly and said specialists would be scheduled to investigate further. 

Other issues acknowledged: squeaking floors, tight windows, loose pony walls on the stairs, and warped or gapped doors. The crew was friendly but offered patch cement work in the garage only; most items were deferred pending additional appointments.
