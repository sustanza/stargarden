During the carpet inspection visit, we discussed that there were likely more significant issues with the subfloor that needed to be addressed before any carpet work could begin. The inspector advised me to call his office, who acknowledged the challenge and provided me with CBH's main office contact info for further clarification. I called the CBH warranty office, left a message, but never received a response.
