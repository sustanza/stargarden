title: "New Home Orientation"
---

The new‑home orientation was generally positive—staff were friendly and noted each item on my inspection list—but the process felt rushed. Several issues they agreed to correct remained unresolved when I reinspected the home in 2025. Recommendation: do not sign the orientation paperwork until you have walked the checklist with the team and confirmed each item has been fixed. There were so many outstanding items that it was difficult to keep track of them all without a detailed checklist.
