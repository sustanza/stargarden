title: "Warranty Update Email - Sod"

Received an email from the warranty team stating the builder had approved replacement of part of the rear sod as a “one‑time courtesy” and scheduled the work for next week—even though we hadn’t submitted any sod‑related request. Replied to clarify that no sod replacement is needed.

Despite repeatedly flagging safety concerns, potential health hazards, and possible code violations, this response raises doubts about whether the builder is taking those issues seriously.
