CBH Homes addressed the persistent flickering issue by replacing several ceiling light bulbs. During the service visit, a technician suggested that “dirty energy” being pushed back through the grid might be contributing to the problem—a theory that adds a conspiratorial twist to the situation. It’s worth noting that the home’s lighting fixtures predominantly use low-cost LED bulbs, which are known to have shorter lifespans due to substandard components like low-quality capacitors, making them more susceptible to flickering and early failure. So, while the “dirty energy” explanation adds intrigue, the root cause likely lies in the economical lighting choices.
