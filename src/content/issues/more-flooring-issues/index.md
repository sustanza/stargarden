> **Note:** I'm a homeowner documenting my experience, not a contractor or flooring inspector. This post is a continuation of the flooring issues we've been dealing with—specifically focused on more areas downstairs.

In this follow-up, I take a closer look at additional squeaky spots, hollow-sounding sections of LVP, and some visibly flexing planks.

**Issue snapshot:** Hollow‑sounding, creaky vinyl plank in the kitchen and dining areas; some planks visibly flex when stepped on.

## More Creaking and Movement

Several squeaking areas have become noticeable—especially in the kitchen and dining areas. As we walk through, you'll hear sharp creaks and clicks that occur without much pressure. These sounds aren't just annoying—they make it feel like the floor is bending under us and that the planks might not be locked down firmly.

## Knock Test: The Hollow Sound

Next, I tried the simple “knock test”: tap the floor. Solid spots give a dull thud, but in several places you hear a loud, hollow drum‑like sound. This isn’t normal for well-installed LVP. That hollow tone often means the flooring is either floating too loosely or lacks proper underlayment support.

In some of these spots, you can even see visible flexing when pressure is applied—exactly the kind of behavior we highlighted in the original leveling test upstairs. It's more proof that the issue isn't isolated—floor flatness and support may be off across the entire home.

| New Symptom | Where it Happens | How We Notice |
|-------------|------------------|---------------|
| Sharp creaks & clicks | Kitchen island, pantry doorway | Squeaks with almost every step |
| Hollow knock | Dining‑room window wall | Tap test sounds like a drum |
| Visible flex | Plank next to fridge | You can see it dip when pressed |

## Take‑Aways for Future Buyers  

- Bring a **4‑ft level and maybe a marble** to any walkthrough—model home or finished unit.  
- Check for squeaks, slopes, or vibrations.
