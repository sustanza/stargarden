# “Level” Floors—Not So Much

## What We Discovered


| Symptom                                                 | Where We Notice It                                                   | How We Verified                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Visible slope**                                       | Every room in the house                                              | 4-ft level shows a visible unlevel surface.                                      |
| **Marble always rolls to the center**                   | Every room in the house                                              | Marble test on video: Place a marble on a level, watch it roll off the level.    |
| **Spongy / bouncy spots**                               | Kids’ playroom, kitchen, pretty much all over                       | When you step, the floor gives a little—almost like it’s giving in.            |
| **Rooms/furniture vibrate**                             | Kitchen, most of the upstairs, super noticable in the master closet. | When someone walks by, you can feel the furniture shake and hear doors rattling. |
| **Lifted ridges, hard lumps, exposed tack strip nails** | Every room in the house                                              | Trip hazards and jabbed feet.                                                    |
| **Creaking floors**                                     | Upstairs hallway, stairs, kids’ playroom, kitchen, and more         | Squeaking, clicking, and more.                                                   |

It started as a sub-floor suspicion, but with the marble consistently tracking toward the center—both upstairs **and** downstairs—we’re now worried the **entire structure may be having issues**, not just a few spots.

## Why It Matters


| Risk                    | What That Could Mean for Us                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Premature wear**      | The flooring could wear out or crack much sooner than it should.                                            |
| **Trip hazard**         | Raised edges make it easy to stub toes or trip—especially for kids running around.                         |
| **Noise & Vibration** | Squeaks and shakes get annoying and make the house feel flimsy.                                             |
| **Resale value**        | Uneven floors are an instant red flag for future buyers and inspectors.                                     |
| **Long Term**           | If the issue is structural, the house could be taking additional stress depreciating the value of the home. |
