# A Beginner’s Guide to Constellations

Constellations are patterns of stars that have guided humans for millennia. Here’s how to find some of the most famous ones and the myths behind them.

## Orion: The Hunter
Orion is one of the easiest constellations to spot, with its three-star belt and bright stars Betelgeuse and Rigel.

## Ursa Major: The Great Bear
Home to the Big Dipper, Ursa Major helps you find the North Star.

## Cassiopeia: The Queen
Cassiopeia’s distinctive W shape makes it easy to identify in the northern sky.
