# The Life Cycle of a Star

Stars are born, live, and die in spectacular ways. In this post, we’ll explore how a star forms from a cloud of gas and dust, shines for millions or billions of years, and eventually ends its life as a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole.

## Nebula: The Stellar Nursery
A star’s life begins in a nebula—a vast cloud of gas and dust. Gravity pulls the material together until nuclear fusion ignites.

## Main Sequence: The Longest Phase
Most of a star’s life is spent fusing hydrogen into helium in its core. Our Sun is currently in this phase.

## Red Giant or Supergiant
When hydrogen runs out, the star expands. Smaller stars become red giants; massive ones become supergiants.

## The End: White Dwarf, Neutron Star, or Black Hole
The star’s final fate depends on its mass. Small stars shed their outer layers and become white dwarfs. Massive stars explode as supernovae, leaving behind neutron stars or black holes.
