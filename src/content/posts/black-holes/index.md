Black holes are among the most mysterious and powerful objects in the cosmos. Let’s explore what they are and why they matter.

## What Is a Black Hole?

A black hole is a region in space where gravity is so strong that nothing—not even light—can escape. Stellar-mass black holes form when massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycles. Supermassive black holes grow over time in the centers of galaxies through mergers and accretion.

## Types of Black Holes

- **Stellar-mass black holes**: Formed from collapsing stars.
- **Supermassive black holes**: Found at the centers of galaxies, millions to billions of times the Sun’s mass.

## Why Study Black Holes?

Black holes help us understand gravity, time, and the evolution of galaxies.
