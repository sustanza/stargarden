# Privacy Policy  
_Last updated: {frontmatter.date}_


CBHReviews (“we,” “our,” “us,” or “the Site”) is a static informational website documenting one family’s experience with a newly constructed home. We collect minimal data and rely on third‑party hosting and security services to deliver pages efficiently and protect the Site from malicious traffic.

---

## 1. What We **Do Not** Collect

- No user account registration  
- No contact forms or comment boxes  
- No first‑party cookies, pixels, or fingerprinting scripts  
- No sale or rental of visitor data—ever  

---

## 2. What Is Collected Automatically

Our hosting/security provider temporarily records limited connection information (e.g., IP address, browser type, visited URL) **solely** for threat detection, traffic metrics, and debugging. Logs are retained for a short period (typically under 30 days) and are not merged with other datasets.

A small, non‑tracking cookie may be set to distinguish legitimate visitors from bots. This cookie does not follow you across the web and expires automatically.

---

## 3. Embedded Content

Some pages embed YouTube videos or other third‑party assets. Interacting with embedded content is the same as visiting those sites directly; such platforms may set their own cookies or collect usage data according to their respective policies.

---

## 4. How We Use Limited Data

- Prevent spam, abuse, and denial‑of‑service attacks  
- Generate anonymous, aggregate traffic counts (e.g., page views)  
- Improve site performance and stability  

---

## 5. Your Choices

- **Block cookies** in your browser—core content will still load  
- Use browsers/extensions that send **Do Not Track** or **Global Privacy Control** signals; the Site honors them  
- **Request access or deletion** of any data we may hold (rare) by emailing **homeowner@cbhreviews.com**

---

## 6. Children’s Privacy

The Site is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect their information. If you believe a child has provided personal data, contact us and we will delete it.

---

## 7. International Visitors

Our servers are located in the United States and other regions maintained by our hosting provider. By accessing the Site, you consent to the transfer and processing of your connection data in those jurisdictions.

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy to reflect operational or legal changes. Material updates will be announced via a notice on the homepage, and the “Last updated” date will change accordingly.
