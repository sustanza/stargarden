## Who We Are
Weâ€™re an Idaho family who bought a brandâ€‘new CBH home in 2024â€”after relocating from Texas to be closer to family.

**Backstory:** In Texas I spent evenings and weekends turning our previous house into a showâ€‘ready listingâ€”new upstairs flooring, sanded and repainted baseboards & trim, fresh interior paint, even a full fence replacement after an iceâ€‘storm felled one of our big shade trees.  
We finally sold it, moved north, and dreamed of *zero* major renovation projects so we could finally spend that reclaimed time with our two young kids and extended family.

The dream collided with reality the moment we discovered uneven floors, squeaky subâ€‘flooring, sticking windows, and a laundry list of other issues in our brandâ€‘new CBH build. Instead of family barbecues, Iâ€™ve logged **countless hours** documenting defectsâ€”ultimately launching this site to share my experience with others.

## Why We Built This Site
Most builder brochures show glossy finishes and staged rooms. They donâ€™t show what a level, a marble, or a cup of water might reveal after move-in. CBHReviews exists to:

* **Document** issues with photos, dates, and warranty claims.  
* **Share** that evidence so future buyers know what to look for.  
* **Track** results from the warranty company and CBH.  
* **Protect** our family and other homeowners by highlighting potential safety concerns.

## Independence & Funding
We have **no affiliation** with CBH Homes, 2-10 HBW, or any subcontractor. The site runs on our own time and dimeâ€”no ads, sponsors, or paid placements.

## Workâ€‘Inâ€‘Progress Disclaimer  

This site is brandâ€‘new and very much a sideâ€‘project. I post updates when childcare, dayâ€‘job, and life allowâ€”so pages may lag behind reality, and typos or formatting quirks will slip through. Expect incremental uploads: new issues logged, old issues updated, and the occasional redesign when I have a spare evening.

I make every effort to be accurate, but **no guarantee** is made that every detail is upâ€‘toâ€‘theâ€‘minute or errorâ€‘free. If you spot something off, feel free to let me know and Iâ€™ll correct it as soon as I can.
