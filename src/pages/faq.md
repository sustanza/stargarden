# FAQs

## Does the builder’s warranty pay for lodging, meals, or moving costs if we have to leave during repairs?

**Short answer:** No—neither the builder nor the third‑party warranty company pays these costs.

The warranty booklet’s exclusions clearly state that the warranty does **not** cover “costs of shelter, transportation, food, moving, storage, or other incidental expenses related to relocation during repair, or any other costs due to loss of use, inconvenience, or annoyance.” In other words, if a repair forces you to empty a room, store furniture, stay in a hotel, or travel farther to and from work, those expenses fall entirely on the homeowner—even when the underlying defect is acknowledged and repaired by the builder.
